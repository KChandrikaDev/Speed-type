## Things to do after the webinar/Ideas

1. Improve the details calculator algorithm to take into account the past mistakes as well.
2. Add colors in the type test (Mark the letters that are typed correct with green and wrong ones with red).
3. Learn about SCSS and replace the CSS files with SCSS.
4. Learn about Redux and use redux in this project.
